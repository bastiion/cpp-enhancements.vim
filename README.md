Some shortcuts and snippts to get CPP/C work done faster

At the mean time it is not much, but for the sake of
a clean vimrc, I want to hold filetype specific settings
in a custom ftplugin project.


## Mappings

CTRL+a  to copy declaration from header and goto cpp-file
CTRL+s  to paste implementation stub
